**CSS Code for Controller Overlays**

This repository contains custom controller overlays designed by me. These overlays are stored here and indexed for easy access. The files in this repository are utilized, via direct link, for modifying another website called [Gamepad Viewer](https://gamepadviewer.com/).

An example of how these overlays are used can be found [here](https://gamepadviewer.com/?p=1&s=5&css=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rparker2003/controller.overlays/master/controller%20custom%20code.css). Please note that in the provided example, the overlay will only display the disconnected screen until the controller is registered by Gamepad Viewer.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any questions! I also do custom designs by request!
