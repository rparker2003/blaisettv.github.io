CSS Code for Controller Overlays

I designed custom controller overlays and used this repository to store and index the controller overlays. 
The files in this repository are used, via direct link, for altering another website called https://gamepadviewer.com/

An example can be found here: https://gamepadviewer.com/?p=1&s=5&css=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rparker2003/controller.overlays/master/controller%20custom%20code.css
Note for above example: Will only show disconnected overlay until controller is registered by gamepadviewer.
